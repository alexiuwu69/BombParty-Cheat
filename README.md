Inside main.py the 2nd argument for the Game class is the amount of numbers one wants to generate (the default value is 5).
NOTE: Don't actually use it in public rooms, my main purpose for this is to mess with friends lol
and currently it only supports the German language (however I don't know if all words a valid for BombParty, since I couldn't test it for now)
Again: Only German pokémnon names work for now, however it seems like BombParty doesn't know all new pokémon(s)
